# Utilizing Unity Game Engine and C# for the Simulation of the Behavior of Electric Field (Experiment No. 203)
###### https://imxaander.itch.io/electric-field-experiment-simulation
## Abstract
Unity is a game engine that can also be used as a platform to develop simulations, games, tools, and many other types of software. Using Unity for simulations is not a new concept, but the potential it holds for simulating various phenomena is limitless. This research focuses on using Unity to develop a simulation game about electric fields. 

Through this simulation game, participants can move the probes, draw lead lines on a virtual conductive surface, and enable electric field lines with a specific number of weight lines, showing the voltages' fluid-like flow from high (positive) to low (negative) electric potential.

Unity's features for game development can be leveraged to improve user interactivity and the overall simulation experience. Unityâ€™s capability to implement simulations in 3D space provides more opportunities to visualize experiments. This research will also utilize Solidworks 2022 for 3D models and 2D graphics creation/editing tools to provide assets for the simulation game. The simulation will be programmed in C#, using object-oriented programming concepts to ensure an organized and readable code structure for computations and interaction handling.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the Unity project files for the simulation game developed as part of our research on simulating the behavior of electric fields. It includes all assets, scripts, and models required to run the simulation.
## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3 or later
- Solidworks 2022 (for editing 3D models)
- Visual Studio (or any C# compatible code editor)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imxaander/ElectricFieldSimulation
2. **Open the project:**
Launch Unity and open the cloned repository folder.

3. **Build and Run:**
